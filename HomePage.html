        <b><p> I make handmade crochet items. One of my favorite thing to crochet are summer tops, but I make everything from hats, scarves, tank tops, sweaters, cardigans, stuffed animals, and flowers.</p></b>

        <b><p>Since many people do not know the difference between knitting and crocheting I'm going to tell you. Knitting uses a pair of long needles to forms loops, and you move these loops from one needle to the other; the stitches are held on the needle. While crochet uses a single hook, and the loops are held together as a piece, and not on the hook directly keeping it together.</p></b>
