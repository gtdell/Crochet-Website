        <img src="Gillian.jpeg" alt="Gillian Dell" width="250" height="250">
        <p> My name is Gillian Dell. I'm a sophomore at Juniata College. I first learned how to crochet when the Covid-19 pandemic first started in 2020. I've been crocheting things for my friends when they request it.</p> 
        <h3> A couple fun facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No one else in my family crochets or knits.</li>
            <li>The very first thing I tried to crochet was a top, and it went horribly.</li>
            <li>The most recent thing I've crocheted is a flower bouquet for my grandmother.</li>
        </ul>
